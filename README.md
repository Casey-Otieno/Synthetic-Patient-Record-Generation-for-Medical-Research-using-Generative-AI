# Synthetic-Patient-Record-Generation-for-Medical-Research-using-Generative-AI
 A data engineering pipeline that leverages generative AI to generate synthetic patient records for medical research , ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations.

 #Components:
Data Ingestion: Collect and process electronic health records (EHRs) from various sources, ensuring data quality and integrity.
Data Transformation: Apply data transformation techniques to anonymize and normalize the data, making it suitable for generative AI model training.
Generative AI Model: Train a generative AI model (e.g., GAN or VAE) on the transformed data to generate synthetic patient records that mimic real-world data distributions.
Data Storage: Store the generated synthetic patient records in a secure and compliant data warehouse.
Data Visualization: Develop a data visualization dashboard to facilitate exploration and analysis of the generated synthetic data.

#Tools and Technologies:
Data Ingestion: Apache NiFi, Apache Beam
Data Transformation: Apache Spark, PySpark 
Generative AI Model: TensorFlow, PyTorch 
Data Storage: Amazon S3, Google BigQuery 
Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI.
